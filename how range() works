# range() function
# range(#) if there is one number then the range will count from 0 to that number (not including the number)
# range (#, #) if there are two numbers then the range will be from the first number to second (not including the second number)
# range (#, #, #) if there are three, then the first two act as above but the third number will specify the "jump" you make
# cont. for example range(5, 10, 2) starts at "5" then +2 as the third number is "7" and +2 again means "9".

numbers = range(5)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

bob = range(-8,10)
for number in bob:
    print(number)

Margret = range(5, 10, 2)
for number in Margret:
    print(number)
    
# You don't need to store the number in a variable you can also just put it in the for loop by itself    
for number in range(5)
    print(number)
