### While loops
# While (haha) the parameters of the while condition are unstatisfied
# the loop will continue, but as soon as it reaches the end condition
# the loop will terminate- so make sure your loop stops!

i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

i = 1
while i <= 1000:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1

i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i * "*")
    i = i + 1
