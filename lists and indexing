# Lists and indexing

# the [] lets you choose what part of the list you'd like to look at
# a [0] refers to the first thing in a list,
names =["Jojo", "bob", "milly"]
print(names[0])
# prints out Jojo
# conversely [-1] is the last thing in a list.
names =["Jojo", "bob", "milly"]
print(names[-1])
# prints out milly

# redoing parts of the list is possible:

names =["Jojo", "bob", "milly"]
names[0] = "John"
print(names)
# prints out ['John', 'bob', 'milly']

# we can also select a range from the list,
# [start index: end index] the end index is not included in the selection
# this does not modify the original list in any way
names =["Jojo", "bob", "milly"]
print(names[0:2])
# prints ['Jojo', 'bob']
