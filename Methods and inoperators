# Methods do not work on anything other than objects, or


# .find looks for what ever you input
# and then gives you the index of that first instance
course = "Python for Beginners"
print(course.find('n'))
# This spits out 5 since the 'n' in Python is the first instance


bob = 'Python for Beginners'
print(bob.replace('for','4'))
# This spits out the string "Python 4 Beginnners"

# logical operators are much more helpful since they can be used for
# most anything
inoperators = "Python for Beginners"
print("Python" in inoperators)
# Gives a boolean answer of TRUE or FALSE, in this case
# it comes out as TRUE
