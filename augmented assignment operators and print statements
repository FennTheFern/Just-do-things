#### augmented assignment operator python AKA
# an operator that is used to assign a value to a variable
x = 10
print(x + 3)

# These cannot be put inside a print statment. Print statements
# cannot have variable reassignemnts in them which is what
# all of these operators are doing
# x += 3
# x -= 3
# x /= 3
# x *= 3

# so print(x *= 3) doesn't work
